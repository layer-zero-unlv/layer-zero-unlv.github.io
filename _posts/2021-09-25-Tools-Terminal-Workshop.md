Come join us for our first workshop of the semester! We will cover
a variety of terminal commands used in the capture the flag (CTF) competition. We will
also go over using Wireshark, a tool for analyzing network packets and also used
in CTF. Even if not participating in CTF, the terminal session will be
useful for those who work in software development and general IT.

Members are encouraged to bring a laptop to follow along. Software to install:

1. Wireshark 
    * Mac and Windows: [download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
    * Ubuntu (linux): enter the commands below in the terminal
        ```
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install wireshark
        ```
2. Ubuntu Terminal (only for windows users)
    * You can install the Ubuntu terminal on Windows through the Microsoft
      Store. Directions are [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview).

If you need help installing any of the software, arrive earlier between 5:00pm-5:30pm and we can
assist you.
