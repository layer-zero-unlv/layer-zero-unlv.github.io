Many people attended the event, both already-existing members and some new faces who were eager to learn more about the organization. To give thanks, Layer Zero treated everyone to pizza, cookies, and drinks with many people coming back for seconds!

The meeting started with Dr. Kim and Dr. Jo, who spoke about the demand for cybersecurity jobs and the benefits and opportunities that UNLV students have. Their talking points included:
- A Cybersecurity B.A. is coming to UNLV in Fall of 2023 or Spring of 2024!
- UNLV is now a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense.
- 2023 GenCyber Camp is looking for camp counselors for the Summer from July 24-28th (if you are interested feel free to contact us)
- The Free Cyber Clinic (an organization that helps small businesses in cybersecurity preparation while giving students real-world experience in the field)

Our President, Michael, then introduced the organization as well as our officers and gave more background into what we do in Layer Zero, this included:
- National Cyber League enrollment has opened up for the spring 2023 season! Layer Zero will reimburse 50% ($17.50) of the enrollment fee to the first 20 people who email us their receipts.
- This semester we’re partnering with Girls Who Code! There is a total of 5 workshops planned between the both of us. They are Intro to Blog Making, Intro to HTML and CSS, Intro to Javascript, a Bug Bounty Presentation, and finally a Bug Bounty Lab. We hope to see you there!
- Got any ideas for any social events? Let us know! We want to create a welcoming community with our members where can get to know each other better and have fun. So we want to know, what events interest YOU the most?
- We’re starting committees at Layer Zero and we need your help. We’re creating two teams, a Public Relations Team and an Engineering team to help us with events, workshops, website development, server development, and more. If you’re interested in learning more about the committees, what kind of work they’ll be doing, or want to join one then contact us.
