Thank you to the Layer Zero members who volunteered for this program. The first meeting
went great, and it was a fun time! Thank you to Mrs. Daun, teacher and club
adviser, and the members of Cimarron's Cybersecurity Club for hosting and planning. Also,
special thank you to Catherine Salemi, from ISSA, for introducing the two clubs.
We are looking forward to to the next event!
