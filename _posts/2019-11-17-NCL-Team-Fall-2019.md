## Congratulations to all 3 of UNLV's teams!
What a fun weekend it was hacking away. Each team did an amazing job this season. Big round of applause to **Red Team Rebels** for placing 19th out of 700+ teams in the gold bracket. We've come really far since our first capture the flag competition. Lets keep it going for next spring.
