On a recent afternoon, Layer Zero officers Alira and Lyle braved the scorching Vegas heat to promote the club at the UNLV Involvement Fair. Seated beneath a humble canopy, club members enticed passing students with gummy bears, cold drinks and good conversation.

If you missed the chance to meet your friendly neighborhood hackers in person -- you’re in luck! Layer Zero, UNLV’s premier Cyber Security club (and only cyber club) will be hosting a club orientation event on Saturday, September 14, 2019 inside the Great Hall at TBE from 1:00 p.m. to 3 p.m.
