We're excited this semester to be collaborating with Cimarron's cyber club and
looking for members to be mentors. Don't worry, you're not expected to teach
your mentee any cyber skills, but more be a guide when it comes to transitioning
to college. We have fun cyber games planned, and this is something you can add to
your resume! This program will help  build an important relationships with other
cyber related organizations and more importantly, provide good role models to
upcoming college students.
