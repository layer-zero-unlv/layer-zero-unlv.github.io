We are excited to announce that we will be hosting our own insntance of OWASP's Security Shepherd training platform!
<h2>But first, what is OWASP?</h2>

The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

<h2>Security Shepherd</h2>

OWASP Security Shepherd is a web and mobile application security training platform. Security Shepherd has been designed to foster and improve security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic. The aim of this project is to take AppSec novices or experienced engineers and sharpen their penetration testing skillset to security expert status.


We will be trying CTF Mode:

When Shepherd has been deployed in the CTF mode, a user can only access one uncompleted module at a time. The first module presented to the user is the easiest in Security Shepherd, which has not been marked as closed by the administrator. The levels increase slowly in difficulty and jump from one topic to another. This layout is the recommended setting when using Security Shepherd for a competitive training scenario.



We will be posting updates soon but expect it live as soon as this week with new instructions on how to request an account and writeups on how to complete some of the challenges and how to seet up a tool developed to test web application security, <a href="https://portsswigger.net"> Burp suite</a>.
