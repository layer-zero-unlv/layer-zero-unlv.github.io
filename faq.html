  <h3 id="q1">How do I join Layer Zero?</h3>
  <p>
    Please request membership at the UNLV Inolvement Center 
    <a href="https://involvementcenter.unlv.edu/organization/layer_zero" target="_blank">website</a>.
    You may have to log into your ACE account. Once requested, it should be approved within 1-2 days. That's it!
  </p>

  <h3 id="q2">Does it cost anything to join?</h3>
  <p>
    No, nada.
  </p>

  <h3 id="q3">When are meetings and events held?</h3>
  <p>
    We won't have in person meetings this semester due to COVID-19. Please
    see our <a href="/calendar" target="_blank">calendar</a> page for upcoming virtual events.
  </p>

  <h3 id="q4">What is National Cyber League (NCL) and capture the flag (CTF)?</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/" target="_blank">NCL</a> is a organization that
    hosts a national CTF competition bi-annually.  NCL is not the only
    organization that hosts CTFs, but theirs is the one we focus on. CTF is a
    game where participants perform challenges and search for a digital flag in
    order to earn points. Challenges cover topics related to offensive and
    defensive security. Topics include: open source intelligence, cyrptography,
    password cracking, log analysis, network tracfic analysis forensics, web app
    explotations and enumerations.
  </p>

  <h3 id="q5">Why should I play in a CTF competition?</h3>
  <p>
    Playing in a CTF competition is a great way to learn more about
    Cybersecurity. It's hands on, and it's fun! Plus, you can talk about it
    during a job inverview :) NCL seperates participants by experience. So if
    you're new, you'll be playing against other new players as well. They also
    provide a well designed virtual gym to learn different tools and skills.
    It's great place to start learning; however, only open to
    those who register. If you're looking for practice questions outside the
    gym, we like pointing beginners to 
    <a href="https://picoctf.org/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a>. 
    For more challenging problems, similar to what you'd find on NCL's
    competition, you can try <a href="https://ctflearn.com/"
    target="_blank">CTFLearn</a>.
                                                                            
  </p>

  <h3 id="q6">How do I register for NCL's CTF?</h3>
  <p>
    See our <a href="/calendar" target="_blank">calendar</a>  when registration opens. 
    We will provide a link, or you can visit NCL's site directly <a
    href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/competition-tab" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    It's $35 to play, but includes all seasons and full access to the gym. To us, the cost is
    worth it. If you register please email us at <a
    href="mailto:layer_zero@unlv.edu">layer_zero@unlv.edu</a>, and let us know
    you registered.  We can help place you on a team when Team Season rolls
    around.
  </p>

  <h3 id="q7">How do I talk to other members in Layer Zero?</h3>
  <p>
    Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/tTRKYrgt7d" target"_blank">discord</a>! 
    We are a friendly community. We have members who are veterans in CTF and
    members who have gone off to work in the Cybersecurity industry. Our discord is a good
    place to network and ask questions.
